h1:  LJ Code 201 - Day 7

Today was a rough one for me. On top of not feeling well and missing class I have been throwing up. On a better note I still did learn a ton. The new reading assignment gave me huge insight on forms and events. Both of these are necessary topic in my opinion to building a great website. Or even a good one at that.

On another note I did have a very hard time with the code assignment. It was hard for me to combine my code from yesterday with code from today. I feel as though I was starting from scratch. I feel I really need to buckle down and spend more time on this.

I'm hoping I can get better quickly as every day we are applying new concepts into our code. The problem is I am having some issues with some of the previous code we learned. On a better not I do feel I am getting better everyday.
