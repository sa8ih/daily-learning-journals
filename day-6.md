h1:  LJ Code 201 - Day 6

Today was intense, we did not cover to much new material but implementing it into our assignment was a little tough.
I learned new lessons on scope and look forward to learning even more.
We did not go too much further into css. Luckily with tools available online I believe I will be fine on that front.
