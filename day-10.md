h1:  LJ Code 201 - Day 10

After all the review I did over the weekend I felt more confident with all aspects of the class today.

I learned that if you don't get something many of the answers are available online. Also, i learned how useful the developer tool in chrome becomes when you are working with css.

I have a good feeling moving forward in this class.
